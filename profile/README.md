# Computational Cancer Immunogenomics Group

Led by Dr Stefano Mangiola at the South Australian Immunogenomics Cancer Institute (SAiGENCI), our research group applies state-of-the-art computational methods and artificial intelligence to unravel the immune systemâ€™s role in cancer progression and treatment resistance. Our work has been published in prestigious journals such as *PNAS*, *Genome Biology*, and *Nature Methods*. 

## Research Focus

Our group is at the forefront of integrating computational biology with multiomic data production. We focus on:
- **Spatial and Single-Cell Omics Integration:** Combining spatial transcriptomics and single-cell analyses to capture the tumour microenvironment.
- **Machine Learning & AI in Biology:** Developing large-language AI models and employing statistical and machine learning techniques to predict therapeutic outcomes.
- **Cancer Immunodiagnosis:** Analysing immune-cell interactions to understand and predict therapy resistance in breast and other cancers.
- **Tidy Data Analysis:** Using R tidy programming to streamline multiomics analyses in `Bioconductor`, as demonstrated in our `tidyomics` ecosystem.
- **Large-Scale Inference:** Constructing scalable infrastructure for analysing expansive single-cell datasets across diverse human populations.

## Software and Tools

Our group has contributed to several open-source projects that support multiomic and computational analyses:
- **Tidyomics:** An R ecosystem for tidy data analysis across multiple omic types.
- **sccomp** A Bayesian mixed effect model for single-cell composition and variability analysis. Test differences in cell-type proportion for complex sigle-cell and spatial datasets.
- **CuratedAtlasQuery & HPCell:** Platforms for large-scale single-cell data analysis and high-performance computing integration.

## Getting Involved

We welcome collaboration from fellow researchers, students, and developers. Dr Mangiola is available to supervise Masters and PhD projects; please email the supervisor contact for further discussion regarding opportunities.
